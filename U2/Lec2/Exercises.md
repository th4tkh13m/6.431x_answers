1. Exercise: Conditional probabilities

Are the following statements true of false?

If Ω is finite and we have a discrete uniform probability law, and if B≠∅, then the conditional probability law on B, given that B occurred, is also discrete uniform.

True

If Ω is finite and we have a discrete uniform probability law, and if B≠∅, then the conditional probability law on Ω, given that B occurred, is also discrete uniform.

False

2. Exercise: Conditional probabilities in a continuous model

Let the sample space be the unit square, Ω=[0,1]^2, and let the probability of a set be the area of the set. Let A be the set of points (x,y)∈[0,1]^2 for which y≤x. Let B be the set of points for which x≤1/2. Find P(A∣B).

P(A∣B)= 1/4
 
3. Exercise: The multiplication rule

Are the following statements true or false? (Assume that all conditioning events have positive probability.)

P(A∩B∩Cc)=P(A∩B)P(Cc∣A∩B)

True
 
P(A∩B∩Cc)=P(A)P(Cc∣A)P(B∣A∩Cc)

True

P(A∩B∩Cc)=P(A)P(Cc∩A∣A)P(B∣A∩Cc)

True

P(A∩B∣C)=P(A∣C)P(B∣A∩C)

True

4. Exercise: Total probability theorem

We have an infinite collection of biased coins, indexed by the positive integers. Coin i has probability 2^(−i) of being selected. A flip of coin i results in Heads with probability 3^(−i). We select a coin and flip it. What is the probability that the result is Heads? The geometric sum formula may be useful here: ∑i=1->∞(αi=α/(1−α)), when |α|<1.

The probability that the result is Heads is: 1/5

6. Exercise: Bayes' rule and the false-positive puzzle

A test for a certain rare disease is assumed to be correct 95% of the time: if a person has the disease, the test result is positive with probability 0.95, and if the person does not have the disease, the test result is negative with probability 0.95. A person drawn at random from a certain population has probability 0.001 of having the disease.

Find the probability that a random person tests positive. (This answer will require an accuracy of 4 decimal places.)

0.0509
 
Given that the person just tested positive, what is the probability he actually has the disease?

0.0186
