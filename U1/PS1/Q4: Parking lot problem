Mary and Tom park their cars in an empty parking lot with n≥2 consecutive parking spaces (i.e, n spaces in a row, where only one car fits in each space). Mary and Tom pick parking spaces at random; of course, they must each choose a different space. (All pairs of distinct parking spaces are equally likely.) What is the probability that there is at most one empty parking space between them?

Your answer should be a function of n, entered using standard notation (also available through the “STANDARD NOTATION" button just above the “Submit" button.)

2*(2*n-3)/(n*(n-1))
