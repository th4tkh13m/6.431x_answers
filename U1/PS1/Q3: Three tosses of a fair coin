You flip a fair coin (i.e., the probability of obtaining Heads is 1/2) three times. Assume that all sequences of coin flip results, of length 3, are equally likely. Determine the probability of each of the following events.

{HHH}: 3 Heads

1/8
 
{HTH}: the sequence Heads, Tails, Heads

1/8

Any sequence with 2 Heads and 1 Tail (in any order):

3/8
  
Any sequence in which the number of Heads is greater than or equal to the number of Tails:

1/2
