1.Sample Space

For the experiment of flipping a coin, and for each one of the following choices, determine whether we have a legitimate sample space:

Ω={Heads and it is raining, Heads and it is not raining, Tails}

Yes

Ω={Heads and it is raining, Tails and it is not raining, Tails}

No

2. Tree Presentations

Paul checks the weather forecast. If the forecast is good, Paul will go out for a walk. If the forecast is bad, then Paul will either stay home or go out. If he goes out, he might either remember or forget his umbrella. In the tree diagram below, identify the leaf that corresponds to the event that the forecast is bad and Paul stays home.
A tree diagram in which the left most node splits into two nodes on its right. The top node on the right is labelled 1 and the bottom node on the right further splits into two nodes even further to the right. The top of these two nodes is labeled 2 and the bottom one is again split into two nodes again further to the right, with the one on top labelled 3 and the one on the bottom labelled 4.

3. Axioms

Let A and B be events on the same sample space, with P(A)=0.6 and P(B)=0.7. Can these two events be disjoint?

No

4. Simple Properties

Let A, B, and C be disjoint subsets of the sample space. For each one of the following statements, determine whether it is true or false. Note: "False" means "not guaranteed to be true."

a) P(A)+P(Ac)+P(B)=P(A∪Ac∪B)

False

b) P(A)+P(B)≤1

True

c) P(Ac)+P(B)≤1

False

d) P(A∪B∪C)≥P(A∪B)

True
